## Line 2 (Merrylee, Giftlee, Merrylee Christmas, and Mega Merrylee Christmas)

Merrylee has a fascinating history. Ready to hear a story? I am!

> ## Merrylee's Origin
>
> Once upon a time, in Santa's workshop, one of the elves opened the gift he was supposed to send to Bruno. Then the gift made the elf be a part of him. The gift jumped all of the way to Bruno's Qualifiers and became an offical Bruno. The end.

Nope, that was not the end, but this file is **not** about Merrylee's origin.

The first Giftlee was when two Merrylees huddled together. The two Merrylees in Giftlee are more than friends. If they seperate, they will be sad until they rejoin.
